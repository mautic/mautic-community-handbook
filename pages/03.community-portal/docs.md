The Mautic community portal exists at [https://community.mautic.org](https://community.mautic.org).

It's the central place where everything relating to the community happens.  Everything from proposing and organizing meetup groups, teams and working groups to voting on the next members of the Mautic council happens on the portal.

It's integrated with a single sign-on service, so you can use the same username and password as you use on the forums.

Members of Mautic have extra privileges such as being able to propose in elections and vote.  [Become a member on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/mautic/contribute), and your email will be synchronized with the system so that you can claim your membership via your user profile.

This section contains various tutorials and video resources helping you find your way around the community portal.  If something is missing or you are stuck with something please do contact us in #community on [slack](https://mau.tc/slack).
