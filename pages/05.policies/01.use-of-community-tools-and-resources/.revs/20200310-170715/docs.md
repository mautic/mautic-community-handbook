title: 'Use of Community Tools & Resources'
---

## Why do we need this policy?

Each contributor might be granted an access to one or more tools or resources provided and or operated by the Mautic Community to fulfill their responsibilities as contributor.  This policy aims to reduce the security and business risks and to let users know how they are permitted to use the tools and resources, and what happens if they are misused.

## Who does this policy apply to?

This policy applies to all contributors. It applies no matter where the tool or resource use takes place. It applies to use of tools and resources (as defined below) on any device.

## Tools and resources

The Mautic Community uses different tools and software, including, but not limited to, desktop software, web-based software, web applications, cloud-based services like mail, storage platform, real time communication services (i.e. Gmail, GSuite, Slack, Jitsi etc.).

The Mautic Community encourages its contributors to use provided tools whenever appropriate. For instance allowed usage includes: communicate with other contributors (i.e. through email, instant messaging or videoconferences), work/collaborate with other teams and stakeholders on project materials (i.e. team documents, project documents, collaborated folders).

## Unauthorized use

Any of the project tools (i.e. email account, software license, chat system) shall not be used for personal reasons and for non-project related activities. This includes but is not limited to advertising products or services in email signatures, soliciting business, and conducting any business not directly relating to your role within the Mautic project. Any usage of the tools that is not related to the project may affect the services availability for the other project users and activities, so it shall be considered as unallowed and unauthorized.

## Security 

Used inappropriately, tools (especially online) can be source of security problems for the Mautic Community. Users shall not:

* Open email/messaging attachments from unknown sources as they might contain a virus, trojan, spyware or any other kind of malware.
* Disable security or malware prevention software or features, as they are essential to protect from security issues, threats, frauds.
* Send and or disclose confidential data of the Mautic Community.
* Access another user’s account (i.e. email account, service profile, messaging account, etc.).

## Inappropriate Contents/Usage

Any of the tools and resources, including but not limited to communication systems (i.e. Email, Slack, Chat), must not be used to send or store inappropriate content or materials. It is important to understand that viewing, storing or distributing inappropriate content via the Mautic Community's tools is not acceptable under any circumstances. 

Users shall not:

* Write or send emails or messages that might be defamatory or incur liability for the Mautic Community.
* Create or distribute any inappropriate content or material through any of the provided tools. Inappropriate content includes: pornography, racial or religious slurs, gender-specific comments, information encouraging criminal skills or terrorism, or materials relating to cults, gambling and illegal drugs. This definition of inappropriate content or material also covers any text, images or other media that could reasonably offend someone on the basis of race, age, sex, religious or political beliefs, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected by law.
* Use tools for any illegal or criminal activities.
* Send offensive or harassing emails, messages or materials to others.
* Create or distribute messages or materials that could damage the Mautic Community’s image or reputation.

Any user who receives or detects messages or materials they consider to be inappropriate should report this to the Community Manager or Project Lead.

## Copyright

The Mautic Community respects and operates within copyright laws. Users may not use their Mautic email to share any copyrighted software, media or materials owned by third parties, unless permitted by that third party.  

Contributors must not use the tools and resources available to them in order to perform any tasks that may involve breach of copyright law. 

Users should keep in mind that the copyright on letters, files and other documents attached to emails/messages may be owned by the email sender, or by a third party. Forwarding such materials on to other people may breach this copyright.

## Termination

Any access to the tools and resources (including email, chat and services accounts) shall be revoked or removed if the user is no longer an active contributor to the project or is subject to sanctions as a result of improper conduct.

## Policy Enforcement

The tools and resources are provided for legitimate business use. The Mautic Community therefore reserves the right to investigate the usage of provided tools upon violation report or suspicious usage detection. Any such investigation will be carried out by the Community Manager and/or Project Lead.

Any breaches of this policy might result in a disciplinary action, up to the deactivation of the user account in any of the tools and resources and removal from the Community.
