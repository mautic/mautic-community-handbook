## Translating Mautic
Mautic uses [Transifex][transifex] to manage the translations for the application.

To get started with translating, please [sign up for an account at Transifex][transifex-signup] and request to join the Mautic project.

Please also join #translations on [Slack][slack] which is the central place to ask any questions you may have regarding translations.

## Translating other resources
We are currently in the early stages of investigating projects to deploy multilingual features on our website, documentation, community handbook and knowledgebase.  If you would be interested in contributing, please join the [Education Team's Slack channel][education-team-slack] and the [Translations][translators-slack] channel.
