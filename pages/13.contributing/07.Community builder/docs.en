## Building the Mautic Community

Our community is at the heart of Mautic, and community builders are the people who help us to grow and nurture that community.  

The [Community Team][community-team] have quite a wide remit, and there are a lot of opportunities to get involved with supporting Mautic as a community builder.  

Whether you want to support local communities or help people to get started as a contributor, or want to find ways to reach out into other open source communities, we've got lots of ways to get involved.

## Getting started

The first thing to do is to join the Community Team Slack channel. Get an invite to Slack at [https://mautic.org/slack][slack] and head over to the channel #t-community.

The team meets fortnightly on Slack, so you can scroll back and check what was being discussed in previous meetings.

### Finding open tasks

Each team maintains its own Jira board, where you can find the current open tasks and a backlog of things that the team plans to work on.

Access the Community Team's board [here][community-jira].

If you don't already have a Jira account, please sign up for one and then ask one of the team to invite your email address to our Jira and Confluence instances.

Once you have access, you can assign yourself to a task.

Please try to chunk down larger tasks into sub-tasks, and then work on each sub-task in turn. You can add comments to the main top-level task, which makes it easier for people to keep up to date with progress.

### Work in the public domain

Unless there is significant reason not to, we default to being open and transparent.  We work in the open, usually on our shared [Google Drive folder][gdrive].  This ensures that if - for whatever reason - someone is unable to complete a task, it is easy for another contributor to pick up where they left off.  It also means we can always find previous work that had been done if it needs to be re-used in the future.

Please always ensure that you upload your work at regular (ideally daily) intervals. You can use the prefix of WIP-filename to indicate that it is currently in progress.

### Update regularly

Please make sure you provide regular updates on the issue in Jira, and if at any point you're not going to be able to complete the task, please call that out in a comment on the issue (or send your Team Lead a message to inform them) so that somebody else can pick it up. 

We totally understand that life happens and it's easy to take on too much. No judgement at all! We try to be respectful of each other by ensuring we give as much notice as possible if we're not going to be able to fulfil a task assigned to us.
