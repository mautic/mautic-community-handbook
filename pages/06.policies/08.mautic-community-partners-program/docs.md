The Mautic Community Partners Program showcases organizations that are contributing to Mautic - both financially and practically - so that members of the community can find service providers who are [‘makers’ rather than ‘takers’][makers-takers] to work with. These organizations represent the ideals of providing ongoing contributions that open source software rely upon.

How do organizations become a partner?
--------------------------------------

There are two elements that we consider when reviewing an application to join the Partners Programme, both relate to whether the organization is supporting the community.

### Financial Contribution

It is required that all Community Partners are financially supporting the growth of the Mautic community as a [Corporate Member of Mautic][mautic-membership]. All memberships are paid annually and via our [Open Collective][open-collective]. Prior to v2 of the Mautic governance model which came into effect on 12th December 2023, companies who sponsored Mautic at $100 per month or more were also eligible.  Companies who were already sponsoring at this tier when the new governance model came into effect and continue to do so are 'grandfathered' in, providing that their sponsorship continues at this tier, for a period of 12 months. This gives them them until 12th December 2024 to transition to becoming a Corporate Member in order to maintain their status as a Mautic Partner.

### Practical Contributions

Of course money is not everything, and in fact contributing to Mautic in practical ways, whether that might be through code contributions, leading a team, organizing official events or meetups, contributing to the Documentation resources that we have or working on tasks in one of our five Community Teams are all vital to the growth of our community.

For this reason, organizations who are wishing to become and maintain their status as a Mautic Community Partner must demonstrate regular, meaningful contributions to the Mautic project from their staff.

We measure this in several ways including through the Community Dashboard, reviewing team activity, and engagement in the various projects that teams are running.

Organizations who are not able to demonstrate a consistent contribution history are asked to spend a few months working actively within the community before their application will be considered.

Ranking of organizations
------------------------

We rank the listings in the Partners Program by their activity over the previous month, with the top three partners listed on the homepage of mautic.org with links to their Partner page.

How do I become a Mautic Community Partner?
-------------------------------------------

### Become a monthly sponsor

The first step is to start financially contributing to Mautic as a Corporate Member if you're not already. To do this you can sign up on the [Mautic Open Collective][open-collective]. Be sure to switch to your organization account before you proceed with payment, so that it's associated with your company.

### Become a consistent contributor

Once you have started contributing financially, take a look at where you are currently contributing to Mautic.

If you are not currently doing so, we recommend dropping a message in the #community channel on Slack giving an idea of the resources that you have available and the kind of things that you would like to get involved in.

We need every kind of skill from development to marketers, documentation writers, project managers, technical writers, designers - basically you bring the skills and we will find a place to put them to great use!

After you have been actively contributing in both financial and practical terms to Mautic for at least 3 months as an organization, please fill out [this form][partner-application]. 

Be sure to include the name of your team members as this is how we will check on the contribution history!

We will review the application and get back to you as soon as we can.
