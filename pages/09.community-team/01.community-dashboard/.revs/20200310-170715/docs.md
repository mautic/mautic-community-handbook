Community Dashboard
===================

The Community Dashboard uses the open-source `GrimoireLab <https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab/>`_ tool to import, analyze, and visualize data from multiple sources in one central location.

It is located at `https://dashboard.mautic.org <https://dashboard.mautic.org>`_ and runs on a Digital Ocean droplet, managed by the Mautic DevOps team at Acquia.

Currently, the dashboard imports:
* All repositories listed under `github.com/mautic`
* Specified channels from `mautic.slack.com`
* All threads on `forums.mautic.org`
* Specified `meetup.com` groups using the tag of Mautic

Data sources for GitHub, Slack, and Meetup are manually specified in the `projects.json` file in the root of the instance, so new repositories, channels, or meetup groups will not appear automatically.

The data is initially fetched, and a 'raw' index is created. This index is then 'enriched', with individuals and organizations being associated and any other associations being made.

Users can be associated with organizations using the GUI for SortingHat, called Hatstall. This requires an SSH tunnel to be established in order to interrogate and manipulate the data, so you will need to have SSH access to perform these tasks.

The data will automatically update and refresh at regular intervals â€“ you can see when it was last refreshed under the 'Data Status' dashboard.
