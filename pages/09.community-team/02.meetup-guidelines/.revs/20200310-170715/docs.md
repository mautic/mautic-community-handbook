Guidance for Establishing Official Mautic Meetups, Groups & Events
==================================================================

The Community Team agreed on 12th December 2019 to the following guidelines for establishing official Mautic groups within the Community.

All meetups, groups, and events agree to abide by the Mautic `Code of Conduct <https://www.mautic.org/code-of-conduct/>`_ at all times.

Mautic Meetups
--------------

These are the traditional kind of in-person meetups based in a region or a town. They are **not** to be created on a country-wide basis.

### General Guidelines for Official Mautic Meetups

1. Mautic Meetups are for the benefit of the Mautic community as a whole, not specific businesses or individuals.
2. All actions taken as an event organizer are with the best interest of the community in mind.
3. Membership in the local meetup group is open to all who wish to join, regardless of ability, skill, financial status, or any other criteria.
4. Meetups are volunteer-run with volunteer speakers. In cases where a modest attendance fee might be necessary, this fee should only cover the costs of the meetup and should not be used to pay speakers or organizers.
5. Meetup groups allow events to be organized by any reliable/trusted member of the community.
6. Meetups are welcoming places where everyone works to foster an accepting environment that is free of discrimination, incitement to violence, promotion of hate, and general jerk-like behavior.

Official groups will have a Meetup group created on `meetup.com/pro/mautic <https://meetup.com/pro/mautic>`_ and a category created in `Mautic Meetups <https://forum.mautic.org/c/mautic-meetups/7>`_ on the forums once the following criteria are met:

1. A thread on the Mautic Community Forums in the `International - By Country <https://forum.mautic.org/c/international-by-country>`_ category indicating at least two people interested in joining the meetup.
2. A clear region or town for the meetup to be based in, not covered by an existing meetup.
3. Two group organizers identified from within the Mautic community, preferably not from the same company.
4. A location confirmed for the meeting, which is an office or community space (i.e., not a bar/pub).
5. A date for the launch event (ideally at least four weeks ahead to give time for organizing, promoting, and getting people to attend).
6. A proposed time and day each month (e.g., from 6 PM on the first Friday of each month) for regular events.

These events (commonly referred to as “meetups,” which can be confusing since people often use the same word to describe the group itself) might take many formats:
* Presentations/lecture series
* Hackathons
* Social gatherings
* Workshops
* Co-working
* A session to help people with Mautic
* Contributor sprints/drives, and others.

Existing groups can be brought into the official Mautic Meetup account by contacting the Community Manager. This will mean that the meetup.com fees will be covered by Acquia.

Official Mautic Meetup groups are also eligible for sponsorship by Acquia as part of their Community Meetup Sponsorship Programme—for example, to cover the cost of food for a sprint event or to bring in a speaker who needs travel or accommodation.

Mautic Meetups Online
----------------------
These are an online variation of the traditional meetup. There are no restrictions on region, and they can span any geographic area.

These meetups will not have a Meetup group (as these must be physical meetups); however, they will have a category created in the Mautic Meetups category on the forums through which members can find information and discuss any relevant issues.

Official online Mautic Meetups agree to the same general guidelines as physical meetups (see above).

MautiCamps
-----------
Where there is a strong local presence, organizers may wish to create an informal regional event or conference, called a MautiCamp.

These will be regional in nature and organized with the support of the Community Team.

MautiCon
---------
There will be an annual MautiCon event that will bring together the international community for a formal conference.

The first such event is being planned for 2020.

It will be organized by the community and will be inviting sponsors to support the event. If you are interested in getting involved, please join `#mauticon <https://mautic.slack.com/archives/CA7RCS7SA>`_ on Slack.
