Building the Mautic Community
*****************************

Our community is at the heart of Mautic, and community builders are the people who help us to grow and nurture that community.  

The :doc:`/teams/community_team` have quite a wide remit, and there are a lot of opportunities to get involved with supporting Mautic as a community builder.  

Whether you want to support local communities or help people to get started as a contributor, or want to find ways to reach out into other open source communities, we've got lots of ways to get involved.

Getting started
***************

The first thing to do is to join the Community Team Slack channel. Get an invite to :xref:`Mautic Community Slack` and head over to the :xref:`Community Team Slack` channel.

The team meets fortnightly on Slack, so you can scroll back and check what was being discussed in previous meetings.

Finding open tasks
==================

To find community building tasks, check :xref:`Mautic No Code Tasks Board`.

This board is organized in a kanban style, where each card represents a task and typically includes:

- **Description** – what the task is about
- **Status** – e.g. *Ready*, *In Progress*, or *Done*
- **Priority** – how urgent or important the task is
- **Size** – an estimate of the effort required

How to get involved:

- Browse the board to find tasks/issues that match your skills and availability.
- Leave a comment on the task/issue stating you’re interested in working on it.

If you need any help, feel free to reach out to the team. Once you begin working on a task, please inform others in the Slack channel.

Work in the public domain
=========================

Unless there is significant reason not to, we default to being open and transparent. We work in the open, usually on our shared :xref:`Mautic Google Drive`. This ensures that if - for whatever reason - someone is unable to complete a task, it's easy for another contributor to pick up where they left off. It also means we can always find previous work that had been done if it needs to be re-used in the future.

Please always ensure that you upload your work at regular - ideally daily - intervals. You can use the prefix of WIP-filename to indicate that it's currently in progress.

Update regularly
================

Please make sure you provide regular updates on the issue, and if at any point you're not going to be able to complete the task, please call that out in a comment on the issue - or send your Team Lead a message to inform them - so that somebody else can pick it up. 

We totally understand that life happens and it's easy to take on too much. No judgement at all. We try to be respectful of each other by ensuring we give as much notice as possible if we're not going to be able to fulfil a task assigned to us.
