Managing the Mautic infrastructure
**********************************

The Mautic services and websites run on servers which need supporting. The infrastructure working group monitors and updates these servers, keeping them up to date with the latest security patches and updates.

If you're an experienced Linux systems administrator and would like to support Mautic by maintaining these servers, your help would be greatly appreciated.

Getting started
***************

The first thing to do is join the :xref:`Mautic Community Slack` and then join the :xref:`Mautic community channel Slack` channel. Please introduce yourself and describe how you would like to contribute.

Due to the elevated access and trust required from members of the infrastructure working group, you must sign a non-disclosure agreement—NDA—before taking on any tasks.

Initially, you start by shadowing one of the existing team members and help with working through some of the routine tasks before taking on tasks yourself.  

Accessing the Jira board
************************

Once you sign the NDA, you receive an invitation to the Jira board for the Infrastructure Working Group. From there, you can begin interacting with outstanding tasks and request assignment to any task that you feel capable of handling.

The board and issues are private due to the nature of the work.

Work in the public domain
*************************

Unless there's a significant reason not to, prioritize openness and transparency in the work process. Collaboration usually occurs in shared :xref:`Mautic Google Drive`. This ensures that if a contributor is unable to complete a task, it's easy for someone else to pick up where they left off. It also means anyone can always find previous work if needed for future re-use.

As this team is often working with sensitive information, work defaults to a private-open approach. Please make sure to update your issues on the private Jira board and share any resources in the private project folder that might be relevant to the tasks you're working on.  

Update regularly
****************

Please provide regular updates on any tasks you're working on, and if at any point you're not going to be able to complete the task, please call that out by sending the Working Group Lead a message to inform them so that somebody else can pick it up. 

Life can be unpredictable, and it's easy to take on too much at once. There's no judgment here. The team's goal is to show respect for one another by providing as much notice as possible when unable to fulfill an assigned task.
