Organizing Mautic events
************************

Events are the beating heart of a thriving open source community, and we have quite a lot of them happening throughout the year. We hold an in-person event annually which moves continent each year, in addition to Mautic Conference Global which is held virtually. Local communities can also host a MautiCamp event - a localised conference for people in that region - and Mautic Meetups which are smaller monthly gatherings of Mauticians.

Whether you want to help with the big international events or the regional and local events, there are lots of opportunities to put your expertise to good use and help bring Mauticians together in-person, online, or in a combination of the two.

.. _Getting started event organizer:

Getting started
===============

Events fall under the :doc:`/teams/community_team`, so your first step is to join the Community Team Slack channel. Get an invite to join :xref:`Mautic Community Slack` if you aren't there already, and then you can join the ``#t-community`` channel.

The team meets fortnightly on Slack, so you can scroll back and check what was being discussed in previous meetings.

Finding open tasks
------------------

The best way to find tasks to work on is by checking Mautic’s `GitHub Projects board <https://github.com/orgs/mautic/projects/21/views/1>`_

This board is organized in a kanban style, where each card represents a task and typically includes:

- **Description** – what the task is about  
- **Status** – e.g. *Ready*, *In Progress*, or *Done*  
- **Priority** – how urgent or important the task is  
- **Size** – an estimate of the effort required  

How to get involved:

- Browse the board to find tasks/issues that match your skills and availability.
- Leave a comment on the task/issue stating you’re interested in working on it.
  
If you need any help, feel free to reach out to the team. Once you begin working on a task, please inform others in the Slack channel.

Supporting a specific event
===========================

If you would like to support a specific event, the best thing to do is find out who is leading that project, and join the relevant public Slack channel to let people know you'd like to get involved. You may need to get an invite to the working group channel, as these are often private channels.

Events like Mautic Conferences will tend to have their own Jira board and meeting cadence outside of the Community Team's regular meetings, you will be able to find this out from the Slack channel.

Starting an event
=================

If you want to start an event in your region, that's awesome. We have some clear guidelines around what events are called which you can find in the ":ref:`Guidance for establishing official Mautic meetups, groups & events`" section. Determine which kind of event you'd like to run, and then discuss your ideas with the Community Team leadership.  

We highly recommend building a team if you're planning on organizing any kind of event, whether it's a Mautic Meetup or a MautiCamp or something bigger. There is a lot of work involved in running events, and having more than one person in the team makes it a much more sustainable process to organize.

Work in the public domain
=========================

Unless there is significant reason not to, we default to being open and transparent. We work in the open, usually on our shared :xref:`Mautic Google Drive`. This ensures that if - for whatever reason - someone is unable to complete a task, it is easy for another contributor to pick up where they left off. It also means we can always find previous work that had been done if it needs to be re-used in the future.

Please always ensure that you upload your work at regular - ideally daily - intervals. You can use the prefix of WIP-filename to indicate that it is currently in progress.

Update regularly
================

Please make sure you provide regular updates on the issue, and if at any point you're not going to be able to complete the task, please call that out in a comment on the issue - or send your Team Lead a message to inform them - so that somebody else can pick it up. 

We totally understand that life happens and it's easy to take on too much. No judgement at all. We try to be respectful of each other by ensuring we give as much notice as possible if we're not going to be able to fulfil a task assigned to us.

Organizing Mautic conferences
*****************************

Here is an explanation of the roles that we have available if you would like to get involved in organizing the online or in-person official Mautic Conference events in the Mautic Community.

All roles will require you to work well with others, as our team is distributed around the world. Time commitments are estimates based on experiences of running previous events.

Note that this would be a best case scenario of having a larger team with people taking on smaller amounts of responsibility. In reality, it might end up that the lead takes on some of the contributor roles, if there are not enough volunteers. 

Generally speaking, the team meets once a week for a 1 hour meeting on a Monday, this has been included in the estimates.

.. note::

   If you're interested in contributing to one of these teams, please first join the ``#mauticon`` channel on :xref:`Mautic Community Slack` and let us know what team you're interested in joining and which role you would like to be considered for.

Online conferences
==================

Mautic Conference Global events are always held virtually. This allows us to involve the widest possible audience and reach our truly global community.

Leads and contributors will have their tickets covered by the event.
