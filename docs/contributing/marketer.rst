As the world's first Open Source Marketing Automation platform, Mautic faces a unique challenges.

Marketing automation is a term unfamiliar to many, including most people in open source communities, who may not realize there are open source alternatives to the tools they use. Similarly, many people in the wider world are unaware of marketing automation's potential benefits for their organizations or that these advantages are accessible through open source software.

You can imagine, therefore, how many people actually know about Mautic.

That's why your contributions matter.

Getting started as a marketer
*****************************

Mautic has a Marketing Team, which you can learn more about in the :doc:`Marketing Team </teams/marketing_team>` section.

The team holds regular meetings that anyone can participate in. Join the :xref:`Mautic marketing team Slack` channel on Slack to get a notification when the next meeting is coming up. 

Finding a marketing task
========================

You can browse the :xref:`Mautic low- and no-code projects board` to find tasks or issues that match your skills and availability.

The board uses a layout, where each card represents a task and includes:

- **Description:** what the task is about
- **Status:** status of the task, such as 'Ready', 'In Progress', or 'Done'
- **Priority:** how urgent or important the task is
- **Size:** an estimate of the effort required

If you've identified a task you'd like to work on, leave a comment on the task or issue so that a team member can assign it to you.

If you need help, please reach out to the team. When you start working on a task, let others know in the Slack channel.

Work in the public domain
*************************

Unless there's a significant reason not to, prioritize openness and transparency in the work process. Collaboration usually occurs in shared :xref:`Mautic Google Drive` or through the team Canva account. This ensures that if a contributor is unable to complete a task, it's easy for someone else to pick up where they left off. It also means anyone can always find previous work if needed for future re-use.

Please always ensure that you upload work at regular—ideally daily—intervals. Use the file prefix of ``WIP-``, followed by the filename, to indicate that it's currently in progress.

Update regularly
****************

Please provide regular updates on the issue. If you can’t complete the task, add a comment on the issue or let your Team Lead know so someone else can take it over.

Life can be unpredictable, and it's easy to take on too much at once. There's no judgment here. The team's goal is to show respect for one another by providing as much notice as possible when unable to fulfill an assigned task.
