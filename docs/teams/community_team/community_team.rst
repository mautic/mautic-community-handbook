Community Team definitions
**************************

Who is a Community member?
==========================

.. vale on

Everyone who

* Contributed code or content to Mautic
* Visited a website to ask for Mautic support
* Has an interest in Mautic, even without ever contributing

What's a contribution?
======================

.. vale off

* All contributions are important for the success of the project, since contributions by newcomers might lead to happy and dedicated core contributors.
* This includes mentions like 'It doesn't work on my server' which too is a valuable contribution - the underlying message being for example 'improve documentation'.
* Even failed contributions are essential, because of how much Mautic can learn when there's a problem. Contribution from newcomers is especially valuable, because they see the project with fresh eyes.

Community dashboard
*******************

The Community Dashboard uses the open source :xref:`Savannah CRM` tool to import, analyze, and visualize data from multiple sources in one central location.  

You can view the data from the last 90 days on the :xref:`Savannah Dashboard`.

Currently the dashboard imports:

* All repositories listed under ``github.com/mautic`` 
* Specified channels from ``mautic.slack.com`` 
* All threads on ``forum.mautic.org``  
* All threads on ``reddit.com/r/mautic`` 
* All Stack Overflow posts tagged with Mautic

Mautic uses this information to determine the activity levels of individuals and organizations within the community, which informs the monthly updates in Slack and the ranking of organizations in the :xref:`Partners' Directory`.

Guidance for establishing official Mautic meetups, groups & events
******************************************************************

The Community Team agreed on December 12, 2019 the following guidelines for establishing official Mautic groups within the Community.

All meetups, groups, and events agree to abide by the Mautic :xref:`CoC` at all times.

Mautic meetups
==============

These are the traditional kind of in-person meetups, based in a region or a town. They're **not** created on a country-wide basis.

General guidelines for official Mautic Meetups
----------------------------------------------

#. Mautic Meetups are for the benefit of the Mautic community as a whole, not specific businesses or individuals.
#. All actions taken as an event organizer are with the best interest of the community in mind.
#. Membership in the local meetup group is open to all who wish to join, regardless of ability, skill, financial status or any other criteria.
#. Meetups are volunteer-run with volunteer speakers. In cases where a modest attendance fee might be necessary, this fee should only cover the costs of the meetup and shouldn't fund speakers or organizers.
#. Meetup groups allow event organization by any reliable/trusted member of the community.
#. Meetups are welcoming places where everyone works to foster an accepting environment which is free of discrimination, incitement to violence, promotion of hate, and general jerk-like behavior.

Official groups have a Meetup group created on the :xref:`Community Portal` and a category created in :xref:`Meetups Forum Category` on the forums once meeting the following criteria: 

#. A thread on the Mautic Community Forums in the :xref:`International Forums` category indicating at least two people interested in joining the meetup
#. A clear region or town for the meetup location, not covered by an existing meetup
#. Two group organisers identified from within the Mautic community, preferably not from the same company
#. A location confirmed for meeting which is an office or community space - not a bar/pub
#. A date for the launch event - ideally at least four weeks ahead to give time for organising, promoting and getting people to attend
#. A proposed time and day each month - for example from 6 PM on the first Friday of each month - for regular events

These events - commonly referred to as “meetups”, which can be confusing since people often use the same word to describe the group itself - might take many formats:

* presentations/lecture series
* hackathons
* social gatherings
* workshops
* co-working
* a session to help people with Mautic
* contributor sprints/drives, and others.

Official Mautic Meetup groups are also eligible for sponsorship by Mautic Partners - for example, to cover the cost of food for a sprint event or to bring in a speaker who needs travel or accommodation.

Mautic Meetups Online
*********************

.. vale on

These are an online variation of the traditional meetup. There are no restrictions on region, and they can span any geographic area.

These meetups have a category created in the Mautic Meetups category on the forums through which members can find information and discuss any relevant issues.

Official online Mautic Meetups agree to the same general guidelines as physical meetups - see previous.

MautiCamps
**********

.. vale on

Where there is a strong local presence, organizers may wish to create an informal regional event or conference, called a MautiCamp.

These is regional in nature and organized with support of the Community Team.

.. vale off

Mautic Conferences
******************

.. vale on

The Mautic project holds annual Mautic Conference events which bring together the international community for a formal conference. Mautic Conference exists in two flavors:

* Mautic Conference Global, held virtually
* Mautic Conference , real-life, intended to move to a different continent every year.

The first such event took place in 2020 - originally planned as an on-premise event, but converted to a virtual event due to the 2020 pandemic.

The community organizes Mautic Conference and invites sponsors to support the event. If you're interested in getting involved in any way, please join :xref:`Mauticon Slack` on Slack - get an invitation at :xref:`Mautic Community Slack`.
