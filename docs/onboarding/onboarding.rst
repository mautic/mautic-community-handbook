On-boarding new contributors effectively is a crucial aspect of the community.

When new contributors feel welcomed, use their time effectively, and see their impact acknowledged by the community, everyone benefits.

They feel their time is well spent, the Mautic project benefits from their skills and expertise, and progress continues.

It should be easy for people to identify where they can contribute, discover projects with open tasks, and receive support in making their first contributions

While each team shares some aspects of the on-boarding process, certain elements apply universally across all teams.
