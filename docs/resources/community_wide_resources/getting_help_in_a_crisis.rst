Getting help in a crisis
########################


As a community it's important to be aware of the signs of distress or dysfunction among colleagues, and be willing to take action to help them. Changes in mental state can be extremely rapid especially when combined with drugs / alcohol, and since community members are more closely connected to one another it's possible that one of the community might notice a problem sooner than those physically close to someone, or their family.

If you're worried about the mental health of somebody in the community, reach out to them immediately to let them know that you care about them and that you're concerned. Then encourage them to reach out to one of the resources listed here to get the professional help that they need.
