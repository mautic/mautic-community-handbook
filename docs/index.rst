Mautic Community Handbook
#########################

This handbook is a central point of call for understanding the management and organization of the Mautic community.

The vision is that it grows over time as the teams and governance structure evolves, with team members adding useful resources and updating processes incrementally.

.. note::

   This project is under active development as the handbook is re-platformed from the old system.
