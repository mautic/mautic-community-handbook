Contributor reference letter policy
###################################

The Mautic project is often asked to provide reference letters for visa applications, job applications, or academic purposes. While we are happy to support our community members, we also need to ensure that our references maintain their integrity and accurately reflect an individual's contribution to the project.

This policy outlines the criteria and process for requesting and issuing reference letters from the Mautic community leadership.

## Reference letter types

We offer two types of reference letters based on the length and depth of a contributor's engagement with the Mautic community:

1. Character Reference for those active < 12 months
   * For contributors who have been active for less than 12 months, we can provide a basic character reference. This letter will be a single paragraph confirming:  
     * The individual's participation in the Mautic community.  
     * The general nature of their contributions - for example code, documentation, community support.  
     * Our observations of their character and conduct based on their interactions within the community.

2. Full Reference for those active > 12 months
   * For contributors who have been consistently active and engaged for at least 12 months, we can provide a more detailed reference letter. This letter will elaborate on their specific contributions, roles, and impact on the project.

Eligibility criteria for full reference
***************************************

To be eligible for a full reference letter, a contributor must demonstrate consistent and active engagement for a minimum of 12 months. Factors that strengthen a request for a full reference include:

* Duration of Active Contribution  
  * There must be demonstrable contribution over a sustained period - at least 12+ months.  
* Leadership Roles  
  * They must be serving in a leadership capacity within a Team, Working Group, or specific project.  
* Team Lead recommendation  
  *  There must be a positive recommendation or endorsement from their respective Team Lead.  
* Knowledge and Engagement  
  * There must be demonstrated deep knowledge of Mautic and active engagement with the broader community - for example forums, Slack, events.  
* Community Building  
  * There should be involvement in a Mautic Meetup group or other local community initiatives as an attendee, leader or organizer

Request process
***************

Requests for reference letters should be directed to the relevant team lead in the first place, who will then escalate the request to the Project Lead if they determine the appropriate level of activity and engagement for a full reference to be provided.

When making a request, please provide:

* The purpose of the reference letter - for example visa application, job application.  
* The specific details or skills you would like highlighted, if applicable.  
* Any deadlines for the letter.  
* For full references, a summary of your key contributions and roles within the community over the past 12 months.

Discretion
**********

The decision to issue a reference letter and the content of that letter remain at the discretion of the Mautic Project Lead and community leadership. We reserve the right to decline requests that do not meet our criteria or where we feel we cannot provide an accurate and honest reference.
