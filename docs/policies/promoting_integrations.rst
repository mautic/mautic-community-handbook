Policy on promoting Integrations with Mautic
############################################

Introduction
************

The Mautic website serves as a hub for the Mautic community, showcasing innovative projects that align with the mission and values. The purpose of this policy is to provide clarity on the criteria and process for listing projects and Integrations on the Mautic website.

Criteria for inclusion
**********************

A Mautic member must propose projects featured in the Mautic Integrations Directory via the Mautic :xref:`Integration directory proposals` page. Integrations must receive at least five community votes and gain endorsement from the Marketing Team for inclusion.

The community selects projects for the Mautic website based on their popularity and relevance to Mautic Users, accomplished through a quarterly vote on the Community Portal of all eligible Integrations. Members of Mautic are eligible to vote.

#. Popularity:

   * Popular projects within the Mautic community have a higher chance of appearing on the homepage as members are more likely to vote for them.
   
#. Use Cases:

   * The community prioritizes projects that clearly align with Mautic's use cases and goals.
   * The Marketing Team assesses how well a project addresses the needs of Mautic Users and enhances their experience.
  
#. Members:
   
   * The community prioritizes projects owned by Mautic members over those that aren't.

Maintenance responsibilities
****************************

The maintenance of projects listed on the Mautic website homepage is the responsibility of the Marketing Team. This ensures consistency, accuracy, and a seamless experience for visitors.

#. Content Updates:

   * The Marketing Team regularly reviews and updates project information to reflect current status, features, and relevant changes
   * Project maintainers should communicate updates to the Marketing Team for timely inclusion.
  
#. Removal of Inactive Projects:

   * The community may remove inactive projects or those that no longer align with Mautic's goals from the homepage to maintain relevance.  
   * The Marketing Team communicates with project maintainers before removal, providing an opportunity for clarification or updates.

Priority for open source projects
*********************************

The community gives priority to projects with an open source nature for listing on the Mautic website homepage. Open source aligns with the collaborative and community-driven spirit of Mautic. The community may also consider projects from official :xref:`Mautic Partners` based on their significance and value to the Mautic ecosystem.

#. Open Source Priority:

   * The community favors open source projects for inclusion due to their accessibility, transparency, and collaborative nature.
   * The Marketing Team encourages the community to actively contribute to Open Source projects.
  
#. Partner Projects:

   * The community may consider projects from official Mautic Partners, even if not open source, if they provide substantial value to the Mautic community.
   * The community evaluates partner project inclusion on a case-by-case basis, focusing on mutual benefit.
