Why do we need this policy?
***************************

Having a Code of Conduct is important - it allows us to define how we expect people to behave in our community. We need to have an agreed workflow and process that will be followed in the event of a breach by a Community member of the Code of Conduct.

Who does this policy apply to?
******************************

This policy applies to every member of the Mautic Community and every contributor of the Project.

Submitting a report
*******************

Pursuant the Mautic Code of Conduct (CoC), any individual may submit an incident report to the Project Lead. They will review the incident and propose recommended actions and/or sanctions. Where appropriate, or where the report relates to the Project Lead, cases may be escalated to the Mautic Council via any Council member.

Incident processing
*******************

- An incident report is received by the Project Lead or Council member - receiving party - and notification sent to the Council of a received Code of Conduct report within 24 hours of receipt. A small committee is formed from available Council members to review the incident report, ensuring no conflict of interest exists with any involved parties.
- The receiving party shares the incident report with the reported person - who has committed the breach - and they have 7 days to submit a response
- The incident report is reviewed and discussed at the next available Council Meeting after the 7 days have elapsed or a response is received, whichever is sooner. Should the incident be of a serious matter and requires immediate action, the Mautic Council may call an Extraordinary Council Meeting to discuss it.
- The Mautic Council shall propose sanctions according to those laid out in this Policy.
- The Mautic Council shall notify all involved parties in accordance with this Policy.
